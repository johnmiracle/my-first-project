I wish to transit into cybersecurity because it has always been my wish to become an ethical hacker. 
While studying computer science in school, when it was time to pick a major, While everyone was picking 
interesting fields, I went on a self discovery mission to find out what i love doing and fields that 
interests me. I found myself in love with cybersecurity. I wondered how a little mistake could destroy
a whole system or devices while the attacker is miles away.

This curiousity led me to cybersecurity. I started self tutoring, exploring, learning to know more and
understand what the terminology are.
